            <div class="rules">
                <p>This is a variant to the famous game Wordle, which is a game where you should guess a five letter word.</p>
                <p>When you guess a word the spaces will light up as green, yellow, or red depending on if that letter exist in the word.</p>
                <p>In this game you guess on a Skylander and try to make out which one it is with the help of the Game, Element, Type and Series.</p>
                <p>(You can only be right or wrong so there is no color yellow.)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Game means from which game it was originally released.</li>
                    <li>The Element means which Element it categorizes as.</li>
                    <li>The Type means if it's a Trap-Master, Giant, Swap-Force, Mini, etc.</li>
                    <li>And the Series means which release it is, which means that some skylanders have been released more than once with a few small changes.</li>
                </ul>
